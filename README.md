## Overview

Toolbox is a Python package designed to assist chemical engineers and chemists with essential calculations in various domains such as distillation, reaction stoichiometry, acid/base chemistry, and liquid-liquid extraction (LLE). The package provides robust functions to simplify complex calculations and visualize key processes.

## Features

- **Distillation Calculations**: Calculate the needed number of stages and generate McCabe-Thiele diagrams for distillation processes.
- **Stoichiometric Coefficients**: Determine the stoichiometric coefficients based on a given reaction string and retrieve properties of the products and reactants.
- **Acid/Base Calculations**: Calculate the pH or concentration of acids and bases in solutions.
- **Liquid-Liquid Extraction (LLE)**: Calculate the number of stages for both counter-flow and cross-flow LLE processes.

## Installation
The package **Toolbox** can be easily installed using pip, the package installer for Python. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/Arnautovich/Toolbox.git
```

It can also be installed locally.
```
cd /to_dir/
git clone https://github.com/Arnautovich/Toolbox.git
pip install .
```

## Usage
For an example of the utilisation of each function please refer to the jupyter notebook here [Examples](https://github.com/Arnautovich/Toolbox/blob/main/notebooks/project_report.ipynb)

### Interface
This project also have an interface based UI to interact with the functions. To lunch the interface make sure you installed **streamlit** package or install it by
```
pip install streamlit
```
Then go to the directory where you cloned the repository and lunch the **run.py** file.
