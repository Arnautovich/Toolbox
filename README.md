# Toolbox [![alt text](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-14354C?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://www.python.org)

## Overview

Toolbox is a Python package designed to assist chemical engineers and chemists with essential calculations in various domains such as distillation, reaction stoichiometry, acid/base chemistry, and liquid-liquid extraction (LLE). The package provides robust functions to simplify complex calculations and visualize key processes.

## Features

- **Distillation Calculations**: Calculate the needed number of stages and generate McCabe-Thiele diagrams for distillation processes.
- **Stoichiometric Coefficients**: Determine the stoichiometric coefficients based on a given reaction string and retrieve properties of the products and reactants.
- **Acid/Base Calculations**: Calculate the pH or concentration of acids and bases in solutions.
- **Liquid-Liquid Extraction (LLE)**: Calculate the number of stages for both counter-flow and cross-flow LLE processes.

## Installation
The package **Toolbox** can be easily installed using pip, the package installer for Python. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/Arnautovich/Toolbox.git
```

It can also be installed locally.
```
cd /to_dir/
git clone https://github.com/Arnautovich/Toolbox.git
pip install .
```

## Usage
### Distillation
This function is used to determine the number of stages required for the give separtion properties. Example of use:

3 stages

This function calculates the number of stages required for a distillation process based on given separation properties. It also generates a McCabe-Thiele diagram to visually represent the stages.

Parameters:
- F (float): Feed flow rate (mol/hr)
- R (float): Reflux ratio
- z (float): Feed composition (mole fraction)
- q (float): Feed quality (ratio of liquid to total feed)
- alpha (float): Relative volatility
- xD (float): Distillate composition (mole fraction)
- D (float): Distillate flow rate (mol/hr)

Returns:
- nb_stages (int): Number of stages required
- fig (matplotlib.figure.Figure): McCabe-Thiele diagram
Example of Use:
```
from Toolbox.Distillation as distillation

nb_stages, fig = distillation(F=100, R=0.5, z=0.5, q=1, alpha=10, xD=0.9, D=50)

print(f'Number of stages required: {nb_stages}')
```
This example calculates that 3 stages are required for the given distillation process. The following McCabe-Thiele diagram is also generated to help visualize the separation process.



# Optionally, display the McCabe-Thiele diagram
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.show(fig)
This example calculates that 3 stages are required for the given distillation process. The McCabe-Thiele diagram is also generated to help visualize the separation process.

# Access properties of reactants and products
reactants = stoichiometric_data['reactants']
products = stoichiometric_data['products']
Acid/Base Calculations
To calculate the pH or concentration of acids and bases:

python
Copier le code
from toolbox import acid_base

# Calculate pH of a solution
ph = acid_base.calculate_ph(concentration, acid_constant)

# Calculate concentration of an acid or base
concentration = acid_base.calculate_concentration(ph, acid_constant)
Liquid-Liquid Extraction (LLE)
To calculate the number of stages for LLE processes:

python
Copier le code
from toolbox import lle

# Calculate number of stages for counter-flow LLE
counter_flow_stages = lle.calculate_counter_flow_stages(feed_composition, extract_composition, solvent_composition)

# Calculate number of stages for cross-flow LLE
cross_flow_stages = lle.calculate_cross_flow_stages(feed_composition, extract_composition, solvent_composition)
